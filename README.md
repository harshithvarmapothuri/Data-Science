# Data-Science
Welcome to my data science repository! This repository showcases my projects and experiments in data science. I use various tools and techniques to analyze, visualize and model data. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, and datasets used in my projects. Feel free to explore the projects and use the code for your own purposes.
